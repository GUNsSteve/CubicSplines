# CubicSplines
HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY:
First, you must initialize your cubic spline variable, using the initialize function and your desired data in a C++ vector.

This generates all the values needed for the pline

The other two functions will display the piecewise equation and calculate the interpolated value at a desired point.
